<p>Hi I'm Tiffany! Iâ€™m a huge fan of eating copious amounts of fruit, spending too much money on matcha from Mind, and listening to book/movie recaps 
    (trying to get back into PJO so I can watch the new show). My current mission is to find the best wide leg pants because I am obsessed.  </p>

    <li>Something I learned from this article is that everything I see on a screen started with a design choice and an intention. 
        Even seemingly small things like putting the word "London" instead of a basic "Search here" in the search bar can change 
        the way the user feels. </li>
    <li>My favorite part of this article was when the author broke down examples from common apps that people use. It was very 
        interesting and different to see an app I use all the time, like Spotify, but this time see if through the eyes of a designer rather 
        than an end user. </li>
    <li>"Open an app you use often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content. 
        Instead, I want you to actively focus on the screen in front of you."</li>
    <li>I would give this article a 8/10. It had intersting examples and wasn't too long.</li>
  </ul>
