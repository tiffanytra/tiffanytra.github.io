				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned to be more aware of when I see dark design in my everyday real life. Dark design has always been around, not just in the digital space. 
							A common example that I have seen often and that was also in the article is advertising low rates/fees in large print, but then having the conditions 
							or caveats in the extremely small font, often on a different section of the page. 
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was learing about all the different types of dark designs. I really liked how the author included real examples 
							and it was very interesting to see how all kinds of companies and websites utilize dark design. For instance, it was the most interesting to see how
							Coursera makes their free offering very hard to find and tricks people in thinking they can only proceed with the "free trial" that will discreetly 
							charge them after the 7 days. I thought that as an online learning platform, Coursera would be encouraging of giving everyone access to learning resources, 
							yet they purposely use dark design to prevent some people  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "There are no easy solutions or alternatives to dark patterns. Industry insiders like Bunker (2013) have suggested that designers should have an ethical code of conduct where privacy, honesty and respect should be the core elements" </p>
					</li>
