                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that using a lot of dynamic shapes and animations on a webpage or app makes the 
                                content seem more engaging. This also makes it more "fun" and interesting for the user to 
                                use and interact with the webpage/app. I also think color was a really important part of UI 
                                designs. They set the mood and tone of the page and can help reflect and summarize the content.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite design from this article was the easygrow.io app preview. I liked how it was 
                                fairly simplistic, with large and bold font in a simple layout. I also liked how the colors 
                                changed and matched with the images of the fruit/veggie, it was very satisfiying to look at.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I think one of the most interesting designs was Midnight Hour by Adam Zielonko. The concept of having the woman's silouette as sort 
                                of sliding transition was really unique. Since the design was called Midnight Hour, I think the contrast of the woman's black dress 
                                versus her light blond hair made for the perfect transition between the white and black backgrounds. The information was also laid 
                                out very clearly, with large spacing between each section, which maintained the clean image that the woman's silouette and the color 
                                constrast acheived.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> I give this a 5 because it was fun to look at all the different UI designs, but I would have liked to have some 
                                explanation or breakdown of what was happening with each design, and how and why the designer's unique choices 
                                were incorporated into their design and the goal of the app/webpage. </p>
