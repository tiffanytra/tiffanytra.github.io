					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is color asscessibility. 
								I don't have a vision impairment that affects the way I see colors, but 
								there are roughly 217 million people that do, according to the article. 
								Even outside of vision impairment, carefully choosing colors is still 
								important for aesthetics and user experience.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is the section on the legal requirements around asscessibility. 
								It is interesting that there are laws that ensure standards around accessibility and that class 
								action lawsuits can be filed if those rules are violated. The United States Access Board and the 
								World Wide Web consortium (W3C) are two notable organizations that establish these accessibility standards. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I give this article a 6 because it was really short. I wish there was more details and ways to use color to improve accessibility, 
								but liked the examples and pictures the writer included. </p>
