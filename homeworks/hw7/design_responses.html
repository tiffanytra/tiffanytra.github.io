						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the Gestalt principles, and how they are subconcious things that humans 
								find appealing and attractive to look at, but can also control how humans interact with 
								visual elements. I learned the word reification is how humans can recognize images/objects 
								that have gaps. I've always really like that style because of its simplistic and minimalist 
								design. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was definitely looking at each of the examples provided
								and taking note of how each of the principles/guidelines made the design not only look better
								but also be more practical and natural. All of these elements are things I have seen before but 
								I was cool getting to see their formal names and definitions. I made a lot of connections to when
								and where I have seen the various principles in practice before and how I have subconciously used
								them in my own work as well. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. 
								It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience.</p>
						</li>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would give this article a 8 because it was well organized and I liked getting to learn about 
								each of the principles with a visual example provided right below for better reference.
