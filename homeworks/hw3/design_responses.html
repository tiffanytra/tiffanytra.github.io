					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned that fonts themselves can convey meaning and emotion to the readers,
							not just words. Some fonts could have been created with a purpose in mind. Additionally, designers 
							can use multiple fonts, and pair them together to create a more visually appealing design or to break text
							into sections. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was learning about the ratios and how we can use ratios found naturally, 
								like in music, to determine the best sizing for fonts. The ratio of things is a really subtle yet
								important part of aesthetics. Our eyes and brain will just subconciously know when something "looks right". </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "For this reason, before choosing a font, research its intended purpose."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I give this article a 7 because it gave me some new perspective on fonts being more than just something 
								you pick at random or just because it looks nice. </p>
