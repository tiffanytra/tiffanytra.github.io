					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that humans have very short attention spans. Animations that take a second can often 
								be considered too long already. The timing of animations is very important and plays a part in 
								catching the attention of the user, not just what the animation looks like.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the side by side comparisons of what a good and bad
								element of an animation. A lot of the differences are pretty subtle, so it was really useful 
								to have the side by side playbacks. I could watch each one to catch how one was better than 
								the other. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "That means that the animation shouldnâ€™t slow down the user or prevent from performing the task." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would give this article an 8 because I enjoy articles where it combines/condenses lots of different
								information into a single ultimate guide. </p>
